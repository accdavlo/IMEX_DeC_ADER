%In this paper, we develop implicit and implicit-explicit ADER and DeC methods

%We reformulate the methods as Runge-Kutta schemes to investigate their stability, discovering  that the methods strongly differ (from A-stable to bounded stability regions) according to the choice of order, method and quadrature nodes, differently from their explicit counterparts. 
%When applied to advection-diffusion and advection-dispersion equations (with finite difference spatial discretization), the von Neumann stability analysis shows that they are stable under CFL-like conditions and for the advection-diffusion equation even under a spatial-independent restriction.

In this manuscript, we present the development of implicit and implicit-explicit ADER and DeC methodologies within the DeC framework using the two-operators formulation, with a focus on their stability analysis both as solvers for ordinary differential equations (ODEs) and within the context of linear partial differential equations (PDEs).
To analyze their stability, we reinterpret these methods as Runge-Kutta schemes and uncover significant variations in stability behavior, ranging from A-stable to bounded stability regions, depending on the chosen order, method, and quadrature nodes. 
This differentiation contrasts with their explicit counterparts.
When applied to advection-diffusion and advection-dispersion equations employing finite difference spatial discretization, the von Neumann stability analysis demonstrates stability under CFL-like conditions. 
Particularly noteworthy is the stability maintenance observed for the advection-diffusion equation, even under spatial-independent constraints.
Furthermore, we establish precise boundaries for relevant coefficients and provide suggestions regarding the suitability of specific schemes for different problem.
