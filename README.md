# IMEX_DeC_ADER
This is the public repository on the work "Analysis for Implicit and Implicit-Explicit ADER and DeC Methods for Ordinary Differential Equations, Advection-Diffusion and Advection-Dispersion Equations" by Philipp Offner, Louis Petri and Davide Torlo.

We collect in this repository all the stability analysis plots that did not fit in the main article, in particular, the discussion with equispaced subtimenodes and the explicit methods.
